I did contract work for <a href="http://LetsGet.Net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LetsGet.Net</a> (now the Online Ordering division of Granbury Restaurant Solutions) throughout high school, and entered Carnegie Mellon University in 2009 to concurrently work on a computer science/mathematics double major and mathematics masters.

Something was wrong -- we as a society just did not know how to engineer software. In particular, I noticed that making architectural changes was conceptually easy, but could easily require man-years of effort (and, in the case of Y2K, inspire many TV shows about the collapse of society).

In 2012, I was named a 20 Under 20 Thiel Fellow, and left school to work on automated software reengineering full-time. I dropped out of the masters program, but spent a month of summer classes to complete a dual-degree in computer science and mathematics, having taken too many courses in my double major.  While studying the restructuring of high-level source code, I founded Project Ironfist, a mod for Heroes of Might and Magic II, experimenting with binary reengineering. We've successfully deployed novel techniques for modifying the game's internal structure, enabling major modifications at a fraction of the cost of traditional techniques.  What else?

Before becoming a researcher, I worked as an engineering intern at Facebook and Two Sigma Investments, and as a TA for Luis von Ahn. I studied game design under Jesse Schell. I was a member of CMU's Putnam team in 2010, and competed at the ACM-ICPC World Finals in 2012. I received a 2nd-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do in 2009, and currently practice Shotokan Karate. I am actively involved in the LessWrong community. I also enjoy playing piano and Super Smash Bros.
