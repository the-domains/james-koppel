**Welcome.**My name is Jimmy Koppel, and I work on **creating highly advanced developer tools **and **making them widespread**. I am currently a Ph. D. student at MIT, advised by[Armando Solar-Lezama][0].

Some things I've done:

* I created [Project Ironfist][1], a mod and expansion for [Heroes of Might and Magic II][2], which has drawn contributions from over 20 volunteers (and has some [seriously cool tech][3] for doing binary modification)
* I founded [Tarski Technologies][4], a startup building a practical tool for [program][5][repair][6]
* I was the third employee of[Apptimize][7], where I built a visual editor for A/B testing mobile apps. My code is probably running on your phone.

While I dream of making it easy to make sweeping changes to software (high-level [refactoring][8]), I am currently interested in [program synthesis][9], techniques for generating programs, and in [language engineering][10], techniques for making this kind of software easier to build. [Here][11] are some of my favorite papers. I also surveyed some of the most impressive results in my talk at the 2012 Singularity Summit ([video][12],[slides][13]).

I am proud to be in the second class of [Thiel Fellows][14]. Before starting the Fellowship, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon with dual degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics.

I am always happy to chat about startups, research, and life in general. I try to respond to all E-mails within one day.
